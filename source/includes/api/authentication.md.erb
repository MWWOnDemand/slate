# Authentication

Customers are granted a API Key that can be used to authorize requests to the application server at <https://api.mwwondemand.com>

<!-- Alternatively a token can be used by making a login request. -->


## API Key

> To authorize, use this code:

<%= partial "includes/api/curl_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>
<%= partial "includes/api/ruby_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>
<%= partial "includes/api/python_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>
<%= partial "includes/api/java_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>
<%= partial "includes/api/php_snippets/post_login_request.md" %>

> Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

If you need an API key, please contact your MWW representative.

<!---
Access to the API uses an API key for authentication. You can register a new API key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/>.

After you register, you can view your API key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/user/api-key>.
-->

The API expects an API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_API_KEY`

`Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json`

`Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1`

<aside class="notice">
In the example code above, you must replace <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
You must include the Content-Type and Accept headers in every request.
</aside>



## Regenerate Your API Key

> To expire your existing api-key and generate a new one, use this code:

```shell
curl -X PATCH "https://api.mwwondemand.com/api/regenerate-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1" \
  -H "Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_EXISTING_API_KEY"
```

> Be sure to replace `YOUR_EXISTING_API_KEY` with your existing API key.
> The above command returns a response like:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Authorization: auth-key=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "YOUR_USER_ID",
    "type": "users",
    "attributes": {
      "api-key": "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

For any issues with regenerating an API key please contact your MWW representative.

<!--

To change your API key make a PATCH request using the `api/regenerate-api-key` endpoint.

- Requires your existing API Key in the `Authorization` Header
- Response Header and body include your newly generated `api-key`

Also, you can regenerate the key at <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/user/api-key>.
